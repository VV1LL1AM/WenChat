__Completeness_& Challenges__


I have successfully completed the following requirement:

1-The chat application will provide a notification to existing users when a new users joins
2-The chat application will show a list of users currently within a chat
3-The chat application will inform users when a new user joins a chat 
4-The chat application will inform users when a user exits a chat

I have completed every aspect requirement of the website except informing the users where someone else is
typing. This relates to some of the challenged I faced implementing the website: Lack of time and knowledge.

To achieve the mentioned features of the chat, I have made use of html forms  for my input box along with CSS to
provide styling to it. I have used javascript functions to randomly assign usernames to people in the chat and add them to a list.

The communication between server and users is done peer to peer. I implemented so the chat's server are the user themselves and 
any changes are instantly drawn into the screen of all users simultaneously.

As mentioned above time and lack of knowledge were the biggest challenges I faced in the making of the website,
I found myself restricted on what I could do with any idea I came up with. For example, I was not able to set different 
text colours to the reports announcing the users exit(red) and entrance(green) to chat.
Using bootstrap alongside CSS was another big challenge one example is redundancy in my code due to applying 
style to bootstrap widgets.


__Design__

I have chosen I simple design consisting of one bootstrap coiner for each page, rows and column tags.
I chose a different range of colours to distinguish different section and content of the website hence easier for the users
to navigate it, however I kept the colours not so much different in the spectrum to preserve the simplified modelled that I planned which 
otherwise would be harder to navigate and very uncomfortable for users to access the content.
