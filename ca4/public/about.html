                  <h1>About the Autor</h1>
                    <p>I have decided to study computer science because I have always been captivated by computers and their impact and influence on human lives.</p>
                    <p> My passion for games as a child introduced me to the world of computing and technology. I remember learning the story of how the internet was invented and being amazed by how single individuals passionately worked together as a team to create a way of connecting people all over the world. </p>   
                    <p>Growing up, I started to realise that technology will be an important pillar of modern society's development, since then my passion for computers has been growing almost exponentially. Imagining myself being part of the team that will design a more prosperous and brighter society makes me very enthusiastic and yearn for the future. People are mostly happy and successful when doing what they love, and computer science is the career I have always dreamed of. 
                    <br> I studied computer science at secondary school, where l achieved a grade 8 in my GCSEs. At this academic stage I have accumulated a basic but varied knowledge on the subject. This fundamental knowledge has introduced me to a more advanced and complex concept of computing in my transition to A level Computer Science where I've further developed the ideas of computing previously learnt. 
                    <br> For example, learning about binary numbers and assembly language expanded my view on how computers really process information and work. This changed my perspective of computers and motivated me to know more about what actually is behind the scenes and not just the user interface that is presented to me on the devices' screen. 
                    <br> For example, Run Length Encoding, used for compression of files - a computer process example that I found very interesting as I required my previous knowledge of binary numbers to understand it.  <p>I am a very independent learner and a curious person; I have started studying other programming languages apart from the ones I learn at school. 
                    <br> My research into languages, such as C++, have developed my knowledge of different programming techniques and increased my understanding of how compilers and processing differs from one programming language to another.  The knowledge I acquired enabled me to understand how Domain Names interact with web browsers to a greater depth. </p>
